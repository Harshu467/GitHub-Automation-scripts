# GitHub Automation Scripts ü§ñ
![](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts/workflows/Flake8Linter/badge.svg)

This repository hosts scripts written in bash and python to automate common Git/GitHub workflows. Normally to connect a local repository to GitHub one has to go to the GitHub website, create a new respository and then add the new GitHub repo as a remote for your local repository. The [create_repo](scripts/create_repo) script automates this process.

# My Awesome Project

Welcome to My Awesome Project! This project aims to improve collaboration and communication among contributors.

## Auto-Comment Feature

The auto-comment feature has been implemented to enhance collaboration and streamline communication within the project. It automatically generates comments in response to specific events, providing acknowledgements, instructions, and reminders. Here's how the auto-comment feature works:

- When an issue is opened, an auto-comment is posted to greet the author and request additional context.
- When a pull request is opened, an auto-comment expresses gratitude and reminds the author to follow the project's contributing guidelines.
- When an issue is closed, an auto-comment thanks the author for their contribution and encourages further engagement.
- When an issue is assigned, an auto-comment notifies the assignee and encourages them to start working on it.
- When an issue is unassigned, an auto-comment notifies the assignee about the change and suggests reassignment if they are offline.

These auto-comments aim to improve communication, provide clear instructions, and reduce manual effort by automating comment generation.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

## Getting Started

To install and configure the project on your system locally, use the command mentioned below:

```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts/main/.setup/install.sh | bash```

## Installation

##### Requirements:
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
- **GitHub personal access token**. (Go to your GitHub profile -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Create new token with all the repository permissions)


#### ```Note!!! This script is written exclusively for Git Bash on Windows, you will have to modify it for other shells.```

- ### Step 1:
Fork and clone the repository locally.

- ### Step 2:
Create a ```github_secrets.py``` file in the ./scripts folder and define the following variables inside it.

```py
GITHUB_API_TOKEN = "Your GitHub personal access token"
USERNAME = "Your GitHub username"
```

- ### Step 3:

#### Add the project path to the PATH variable (Recommended)

Run the following command in the project's base directory to add the scripts path to the PATH environment variable.

```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH":"$(pwd)"/scripts"
```

To permanently add the scripts path to the PATH variable, run the below command in the project's root directory. (This file is located in your home directory)  

**Make sure to backup the .bash_profile file elsewhere before making any changes to it.**

```sh
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH''":'"$(pwd)"'/scripts''"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.75rem">OR</p>

#### Run the following commands in the project folder to add the scripts to your bin directory
```sh
$ cp -r /scripts/* /usr/bin/
```

## How to use
After the installation is complete then the 'create_repo' command should execute in any directory.

- Run the command with a '-h' flag to see the help menu
```sh
create_repo -h
```
- Sample usage
```sh
create_repo <PATH_NAME> <REPO_NAME>
```
- <PATH_NAME> is the path where you want to create the local repository and <REPO_NAME> is the name for your repo
- Example:
```sh
create_repo . test-repo
```
The result is a local respository is created with a connected remote repository automatically!
